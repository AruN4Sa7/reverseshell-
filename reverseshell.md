Shellcode is defined as a set of instructions injected and then executed by an exploited program. Shellcode is used to directly manipulate registers and the functionality of a exploited program. We can of course write shell codes in the high level language but would let you know later why they might not work for some cases, so assembly language is preferred for this. I would take an clean example of the exit() syscall used for exiting from a program. Many of you might be wondered to see why this being used is, the reason is the newer kernel donâ€™t allow anymore the code execution from the stack so we have to use some C library wrapper or libc (responsible for providing us the malloc function).
